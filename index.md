## About Me

I’m a PhD student at **EPFL (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne)** working in the **Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS2)** with **Prof. Pierre Vandergheynst**. My research focuses on **graph representation learning** applied to **protein structures**, where I explore advanced graph neural network techniques to tackle oversquashing and oversmoothing—two major limitations in current GNN architectures.

Currently, I’m developing **novel graph rewiring techniques** for molecular graphs, aiming to improve performance in tasks like **protein classification**, **structural similarity**, and **structure generation**, with future extensions toward **molecular dynamics**.
